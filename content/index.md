==========================

My name is Benjamin, I was born in the year 1999 and I am studying web develoment at Blekinge Institute of Technology, and working as an IT-Support consultant.

During my free time, i enjoy:
+ Books - Particularly [Brandon Sanderson's](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/ "Sanderson's webpage") works.
+ Computer games, my favorite being The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim
+ TCG Magic: The Gathering and playing at my local game store.

I'm looking forward to learning a lot more about design and webpages in this course.
