Analysis of styling in Newssites
=======================

<div class="sub-grid-a sub-wrap-a urv" markdown=1>

Selection
-----------------------

<div class = "r1" markdown=1>

My first selection for website analysis is [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com), and i chose it due to the nature of it being an american newssite.

It will be interesting to be able to contrast the styles used between different countries, depending on the purpose and scope of the website.

Although CNN is an American corporation, it broadcasts internationally across several countries, and therefore will try to appeal to a larger audience than the other chosen sites.

</div>

<div class = "r2" markdown=1>

The second selection for website analysis is [SVT](https://www.svt.se).

This is a swedish, state-run webpage purely aimed att delivering news and information to the general public in the country. Contrasting this page to an international, and a for-profit swedish newssite.

</div>


<div class = "r3" markdown=1>

The last selection for website analysis is [Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/).

It is a popular swedish for-profit newssite. All of the websites chosen are newssites with a similar goal in mind, however they differ in reach, popularity and purpose.

Methodology
-----------------------

<div class = "r1" markdown=1>

To gather the color-codes used in the website, I use the color-pipette available in the firefox webbrowser, as well as the [Adobe Colorwheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to map the color harmony that was applied when designing the website.

To the left are some of the prominent colors used from each website. 

I sampled the most prominent colors from each website, and entered them into adobe's color wheel function. 

This enabled to gather some form of a color-scheme which i could cross-reference to the examples that we learned from in the "Introduction to Color Theory" [article](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437a).

CNN and SVT have a more grayscale monochromatic color-scheme with a single accent-color, both being red. Comparatively, Aftonbladet utilizes a Triadic color scheme for its accents, using shades of red and yellow with a strong blue, while maintaining the status-quo of the gray/white framing, that it shares with SVT.

### CNN

CNN prioritizes their own font CNN Sans Display with fallbacks to the following: 

1. Helvetica Neue 
2. Helvetica
3. Arial
4. Utkal
5. sans-serif

For the headers, mainly for the large headlines the CNN Display is Bold, as well as for lesser sub-titles. A medium boldness is used for links to other parts of the site, and regular for article content or preview. The website mainly ises its own headers instead of elements such as h1. Howver h2 is used for less important, category links. Span "headers" for more important stories tend to be larger.

### SVT

SVT Similarly, has their Publik custom font with fallbacks to:

1. Helvetica
2. Arial
3. Nimbus Sans L
4. Bitsream Vera Sans
5. sans-serif

Instead of having varying font-families for titles, and text content, SVT uses h1 for their headings, and adjusting size appropriately with respect to the corresponding articles relevance or importance.

The the different sections of the articles are wrapped in varying divs to style headers and paragraphs individually, allowing for a reduced variety of html elements. Header divs and spans have a heavier weight as well as subheadings though to a lesser extent.

### Aftonbladet

Aftonbladet uses different fonts for its headers and paragraphs and sub-headings. For the larger, more pressing headlines Verdana Bold is used, with Arial used for the body text, and Arial Bold for article-subheadings. Similarly to the other websites covered, fallbacks include:

1. Arial (Headings)
2. Helvetica
3. Verdana (body text)
4. Geneva
5. sans-serif

Using Verdana Bold with a larger font size, line height and weight for the headlines, along with Arial for body-text and subheadings allows large attention-grabbing article titles, witch clear and legible content for the article. Apart from the large styling, the font-family usage is inoffensive. The more common choice of font-family can be contrasted to the large amount of advertisements visible on the page, usually with very stylized fonts and imagery.

<div class = "r3" markdown=1>

All of the newssites that were chosen have a very common theme of having a main red accent color, which is in-theme for a newssite and seems to be a common trend. Although all sites share red as an accent color, SVT and CNN allows the rest of the content to be more muted in its color-scheme, and using a monochromatic color-scheme for the rest of the webpage structure. In turn the red sections stand out, and are highlited more. This is also more inoffensive and allows the sites to reach a wider audience, which would be a common goal for both CNN and SVT, as international and state-run newssites respectively.

Aftonbladet on the other hand, has a more varied color-scheme partially as it covers a wider range of topics, categorizing content mainly with color, having ads styled with blue headers, sports with pastel-pink backgrounds and health-related with pale yellow.

Analysis
-----------------------

<div class = "r1" markdown=1>

From what we can gather from the color selection from all websites, the common theme is to use a red hue as the main accent for the website. 

As said in the previously mentioned [article](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437a), it is commonly used to invoke emotion and excitement in the viewer.

From a layman's perspective, red is also a very striking color that is commonly associated with urgency. Thus it is not surprising that this is a commonly occuring accent color across all three websites.

A brigther background with slightly darker shades to frame important objects on the websites is also common, however it varies greatly in how it is used.

SVT uses gray shades to frame articles and objects, whilst CNN uses none.

As a result, CNNs website is structured quite differently compared to SVT, and may appear more cluttered and less structured in comparision.

However the limited color-scheme used by CNN and SVT allows for a more simple, sophisticated style. A less flashy theme lets the contents of the articles and related be the main selling-point.

</div>

<div class = "r2" markdown=1>

Contrasting the two more simple but, still effective designs of CNN and SVT to Aftonbladet, we notice a clear difference in how the colors are chosen.

Unlike CNN and SVT, aftonbladet contains a larger amount advertisements surrounding the main news articles of the website.

The colors blue and yellow are used for non-news related items, such as advertisements and health articles, which becomes form categorization that the viewer can clearly see. 

The main goal of this website, is however to sell and generate clicks.

Therefore the more varied use of color on the website allows it to compete with the ads that are present between and to the side of articles.

By use of the occasional red font on certain articles, it incites urgency in the viewer to click on the article. This is not commonly seen on the other sites covered in this review. 

</div>


<div class = "r3" markdown=1>

All sites use a bright background with a darker font, typically black or very dark gray.

Aftonbladet's use of a more heavy, impactful font is similar to what we see with CNN and SVT, although it by far has the largest font-size for its headers in comparison to the others. Again, this is due to the need to compete for the viewers attention, that may otherwise be preoccupied with the ads on the site.

SVT, and CNN however do not have this problem. The comparatively smaller titles still are easy to read by the viewer and are able to grab the users attention. A font size that is too large without proper context may be jarring for viewers, or may distract from smaller, yet still important pieces.

SVT and CNN may still use red font styling, typically to showcase the covering of a live event. This selective use of accented fonts is effective with guiding the viewer to urgent or ongoing topics, and a red font is especially useful for this purpose.
