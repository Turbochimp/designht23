Analysis of design principles on gaming websites.
=======================

<div class="sub-grid-a sub-wrap-a urv" markdown=1>

Selection
-----------------------

<div class = "r1" markdown=1>

The websites selected for analysis in this exercise will largely focus on gaming-related information websites. 

In particular, the focus will be on websites mainly pertaining or relating to the MOBA - League of Legends.

Due to the high popularity and the high amount of knowledge required to play the game at an average skill-level, the demand for information centres with regards to in-game itemization, character guides and player statistics has increased proportionally.

The article will therefore overview the design principles for these sites, and see what design choices and principles each of the developers have implimented, and which seems to be more efficient. 

The websites chosen are as follows:

1. [u.gg](https://www.u.gg)
2. [op.gg](https://www.op.gg)
3. [Deeplol.gg]((https://www.deeeplol.gg))

Due to personal time-investment into the related video-game, these websites are, in my experience the most commonly used websites to find information related to the game.

However, the last website deeplol is a lot newer and mainly experiencing traffic in South Korea, and features more detailed player statistics supposedly provided by AI analysis.

<div class = "r3" markdown=1>

Since these websites are not directly funded by the company that owns the related video-game, the main purpose of these websites will be to:

1. Be the most efficient/accessible source of information.
2. Display advertisements efficiently to fund the website.
3. Attempt to sell other features to the user, such as software alternatives.

Since the market for these kinds of websites is heavily saturated, with many users searching for game-related information, the website must perform well and receive many users regularly to appear more on search-engine results.

Methodology
-----------------------

<div class = "r1" markdown=1>

The main source of theory with regards to design principles and theory will be based off content from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/), as well as [The Principles of Beautiful Web Design](https://dbwebb.se/kunskap/boken-the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design).

Even though the sites reviewed are meant to be more functional than fashionable, they must still employ an efficient stylization to grab the users attention, while still maintaining ease of accessibility, not being too cluttered and letting the information of the webpages be the main focus and content.

### Emphasis by Placement

#### Main Functionality

Common among all of these websites, is the placement of the main functionality website function: the search box.

By placing it in the center-top of the landingpage, the users attention is directed immediately to the function that they are most likely to use.

As the main search function provides a method to search for all types of information on the website, all three websites provide options to filter search results by region next to the search-bar. 

An easily modified search is also key to the users' experience, thus the region modifier is placed to the left or right of the search box.

The main content of search results for characters, feature the most commonly viewed statistics near the search bar's placement, directing the viewer to the information that they are most likely to be interested in.

#### Continuance

The other content, is placed directly below the main functionality.
    It allows the viewer to scroll or pan down immediately to directly view the other resources available on the website.

This also allows the website owners, if they choose to, to sell advertising space in a position where the user is more likely to view it.

By placing advertisements near or immediately below the search bar, users who still only visit the website for the main functionality will still most likely see the advertisements.

Deeplol.gg is an exception in this case, as the only element at the center of the page, is the search bar and the website logotype.

The sites u.gg and op.gg also effectively advertise their own software, by placing linking elements near the center functionality.

### Grid Theory and Contrast

#### Layout

All websites appear to loosely follow the rule of thirds, with all the main content for a character being centered in the middle of the webpage. 

The main middle column is then divided into thirds, having some content spanning a varying amount of columns, or shifting the size of columns depending on the relevancy of the information contained.

All of the content for the websites also fits within 3-4 rows, concentrating the information and minimizing the amount of scrolling necessary to view all information.

Structurally however, few of the websites regularly use the grid functionality to structure the actual content, and mostly lean towards using flex functionality.

#### Contrast

The content pages share the property in all using monochromatic colors in the character pages to aid in structuring the layout, yet still giving contrast to give proper clarity for the viewer.

Color and contrast for statistics vary between each site, but commonly, shades of blue and red are used to indicate positive and negative trends respectively, in line with what is commonly associated with positive and negative.
