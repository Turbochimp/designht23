About
==========================

For the construction of this website we use preprocessing to stylize the content for more effective, structured and maintainable CSS.
For colouring variables and Mixins are useful for keeping the same general style in the websites header, footer and main, but with some simple variation.

Nesting is also an easier way to structure code, and along with variables making the styling more DRY is a benefit when having to change or redo larger parts of the webpages style.

In the future, the use of inheritance, modules and operators will help greatly when it comes to creating varying leayouts for different webpages, making the design more appropriate with relation to the content displayed.
